When dealing with React hooks dependencies:
- NEVER immediately reach for eslint-disable comments
- ALWAYS understand why a dependency is flagged
- If a dependency should trigger re-runs: include it
- If it shouldn't: restructure the code so it's not needed inside the effect
- Use useMemo/useCallback for stable references to complex expressions
- Work WITH React's dependency system, not against it
- Prefer clear, simple code over clever optimizations
