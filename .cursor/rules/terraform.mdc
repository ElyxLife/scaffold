- Always use terraform when creating infrastructure. DO NOT use adhoc scripts.
- Create a folder called terraform/ with all the terraform files.
- Deployment is done by running terraform/deploy.sh. It uses cli to set up permissions. Only include things in deploy.sh that cannot be done using terraform.
- Set up terraform assuming it will be used in multiple environments (eg. atleast staging and prod).
- Use the terraform console to extract variables from the tfvars file.
