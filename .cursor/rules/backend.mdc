Prefer typescript over python.


Check with the user before using other languages, and document the reason for doing so.

### Python Backend
- Use uv to manage python packages.
- Use pydantic to write backend code. If you need an API, use fastapi.
- When you use a python package, explicitly use the following command to find the LATEST version of the package and use it, unless specifically asked not do so.

`pip index versions <package>`
