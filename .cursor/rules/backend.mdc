Use python (with pydantic and fastapi) or typescript for backend code, unless there is a very good reason to use something else.

- When you use a python package, explicitly use the following command to find the LATEST version of the package and use it, unless specifically asked not do so.

`pip index versions <package>`

--
- Use uv to manage python packages.
- Use pydantic to write backend code. If you need an API, use fastapi.
